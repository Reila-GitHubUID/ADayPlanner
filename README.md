## Usage
You will notice that the current day and date are displayed at the top of the calendar.

The app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot should represent one hour and contain the following:

* The time

* A field to hold user input

* A save button

* Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.

* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.
